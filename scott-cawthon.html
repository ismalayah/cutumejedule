It contains character profiles, easter eggs, tips on playing the games, and theories sprouted from the franchise.</p><p>On July 3, 2017, Cawthon announced the cancellation of a sixth main installment to Five Nights at Freddy's, after previously stating a month earlier that a sixth game was in the works. He reasoned that it was because he had been neglecting other important things in his life, but said that he was not planning to abandon the series and may release a FNaF World-styled spin-off game in the future. However, with the release of Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator on December 4, 2017, this was confirmed to be a troll.</p><p>On December 26, 2017, Cawthon released the second guidebook for Five Nights at Freddy's called Survival Logbook. Unlike previous book releases, Survival Logbook has no listed Amazon Kindle editions, implying that it has pages designed for physical writing as opposed to simply reading from a device. The book, disguised as a normal children's activity book, contains many things to do, including a word search, grid drawing, and fill-in-the-blank activities, however all of these were found to hold secrets involving the lore.</p><p>In January 2017, Cawthon stated that partially due to "problems within the movie industry as a whole", the film "was met with several delays and roadblocks" and it was "back at square one", but he promised "to be involved with the movie from day one this time, and that's something extremely important to me. I want this movie to be something that I'm excited for the fanbase to see."</p><p>In March 2017, Cawthon tweeted a picture at Blumhouse Productions, suggesting the film had a new production company.</p><p>In May 2017, producer <a href=#>Jason Blum</a> confirmed the news, claiming he was excited and working closely with Cawthon on the adaptation.</p><p>In June 2017, <a href=#>Gil Kenan</a> said he was no longer directing the Five Nights at Freddy's film after Warner Bros. Pictures' turnaround.</p><p>On May 21, 2016, Cawthon released a teaser trailer for Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location, featuring two new animatronics as well as circus-themed variations of Foxy and Freddy from the series. The game was released on October 7, 2016, and was generally well received. Cawthon then released a free custom night update on December 2, with "Golden Freddy Mode" being added to the update soon after.</p><p>On June 24, 2016, Cawthon announced that he had made a three-book deal with Scholastic Corporation and that the first book (The Silver Eyes) would be reprinted on paperback in October that year, with the second and third being released in 2017 and 2018.</p><p>Soon after the release of Five Nights at Freddy's 2, Cawthon removed all information from his official site and replaced it with an image of the word "offline". The website soon began to show teasers of Five Nights at Freddy's 3, which was released on March 2, 2015.</p><p>On July 23, 2015 , Cawthon released the fourth game of the Five Nights at Freddy's horror series, entitled, Five Nights at Freddy's 4. A free "Halloween" update was released on October 31, 2015.</p><p>On September 15, 2015, Cawthon announced the development of a new role-playing video game (RPG), titled FNaF World. The game is not a horror game; rather, it is a stylized RPG. It was released on January 21, 2016. Four days later, Cawthon pulled it from Steam, not satisfied with the results, and released an improved version on Gamejolt for free on February 8.</p><p>In December 2015, Scott Cawthon released teasers for his first novel, Five Nights at Freddy's: The Untold Story, soon to be renamed Five Nights at Freddy's: The Silver Eyes. The book was released on December 17, 2015, as an e-book for The Amazon; a paperback edition is also available. According to Cawthon, the book was released earlier than its planned release date due to a mistake on Amazon's part.</p><p>Warner Bros. Pictures announced in April 2015 that it had acquired the rights to adapt the series to film. Roy Lee, <a href=#>David Katzenberg</a>, and <a href=#>Seth Grahame-Smith</a> were set to produce. Grahame-Smith stated that they would collaborate with Cawthon "to make an insane, terrifying and weirdly adorable movie". In July 2015, <a href=#>Gil Kenan</a> signed to direct the adaptation and co-write it with Tyler Burton Smith.</p><p>March 12, 2015 (Mobile) February 4, 2020 (Mobile Remaster)</p><p>August 3, 2015 (Mobile) January 16, 2020 (Mobile Remaster)</p><p>On June 13, 2014, Cawthon submitted Five Nights at Freddy's to Steam's Greenlight system. A trailer was released the following day on June 14 with a demo following on July 24, 2014. On July 24, 2014, he then submitted it to both IndieDB, where it gained a massive amount of popularity. He submitted the game a third time to Desura on August 13, 2014. The game was accepted in Steam's Greenlight on August 18, 2014 and was released for $4.99. The game was well-received by critics, and became the subject of numerous popular Let's Play videos on YouTube.</p><p>On November 10, 2014, Cawthon released the first sequel titled, Five Nights at Freddy's 2 for $7.99 on Steam.</p><p>September 11, 2014 (Mobile) July 30, 2019 (Mobile Remaster)</p><p>November 20, 2014 (Mobile) October 29, 2019 (Mobile Remaster)</p><p>On March 19, 2007, Cawthon uploaded the first part of an eight-part series titled The Pilgrim's Progress to his YouTube channel. The animation is a retelling of John Bunyan's novel of the same name. After releasing The Pilgrim's Progress, Cawthon developed several games, including Sit N' Survive, Chipper and Sons Lumber Co., and The Desolate Hope. Some of these were submitted to Steam Greenlight. While The Desolate Hope made it through the process, some games, most notably Chipper and Sons Lumber Co., were heavily criticized by prominent reviewers for having characters that moved and interacted with each other like animatronic machines. While initially discouraged, almost to the point of stopping game development completely, Cawthon eventually decided to use the animatronic-like characters to his advantage, sparking the development of Five Nights at Freddy's.</p><p>The beginning of Cawthon's career in game design and animation can be dated back to the 1990s. Cawthon revealed his first game (titled Doofas) during a livestream, which he made when he was a child. This game later became a troll game as the "demo" of Ultimate Custom Night. His first official games were released in the early 2000s, one of the earliest known being RPG Max, released in 2002. He later joined Hope Animation, where he created animations for children based on Christian values.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfqLCwwNNmmpqvpJ28rw%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fscott-cawthon.html&title=Scott%20Cawthon%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fscott-cawthon.html&description=Scott%20Cawthon%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fscott-cawthon.html&title=Scott%20Cawthon%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fscott-cawthon.html&title=Scott%20Cawthon%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fscott-cawthon.html&text=Scott%20Cawthon%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fscott-cawthon.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Martina Birk</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-09-07</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./submergence-2018.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Submergence movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2018)</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./is-garageband-available-for-windows.html><h3>Is garageband available for windows >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
